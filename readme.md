## f1 stats

Has F1 gotten interesting again from its era of AI slop?


### Test 1
Checking how many positions are exchanged between racers, per race, then per season. Also first three races also separately checked just for fun. A more interesting race should have more swaps.

_Is F1 getting more interesting again? _ **Inconclusive**.

Season 2023: Swaps = 0.35, First3 = 0.28
Season 2024: Swaps = 0.29, First3 = 0.27
```

### Test 2
There should be a lower variance in points as the races become more competitive. It is possible that the peak however is sharp with a long tail. So all 4 moments are checked.

_Is F1 getting more interesting again? _ **Yes. I hereby declare the slump of 2018-2024 over**.
